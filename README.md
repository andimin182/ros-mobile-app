## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Getting Started

Before launching the Flutter app, ensure your ROS 2 environment on the Raspberry Pi is ready:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Start the **rosbridge server**:

```bash
ros2 launch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket_launch.xml
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Launch the ROS 2 motor node that listens for commands:

```bash
ros2 run drivers_pkg motor_node
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Launch the Flutter application and connect it to the Raspberry Pi IP address.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Connection & Usage
Ensure your mobile device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the Raspberry Pi.

Use the on-screen controls to send motor commands.

Example: controlling the throttle and steering through the app interface.
